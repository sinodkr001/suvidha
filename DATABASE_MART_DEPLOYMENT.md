# Database Mart Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Build Completed Successfully!

Your React application has been built successfully. The build files are located in the `dist` folder.

## üìÅ Build Files Created

Based on the build output, the following files were generated:
- `dist/index.html` (0.83 kB)
- `dist/assets/index-Dsp-C19t.css` (48.12 kB)
- `dist/assets/index-juSBwF-9.js` (439.68 kB)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps for Database Mart

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files

1. **Navigate to the `dist` folder** in your project
2. **Select all files and folders** inside the `dist` directory
3. **Copy them** to prepare for upload

### Step 2: Upload to Database Mart

1. **Log in to your Database Mart hosting control panel**
2. **Navigate to File Manager** or **FTP/SFTP access**
3. **Go to your website's root directory** (usually `public_html` or `www`)
4. **Upload all files from the `dist` folder** to the root directory

### Step 3: Configure Server (Important!)

Database Mart likely uses **Apache** server. Make sure the `.htaccess` file is uploaded to handle React Router:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Handle Angular and React Router
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]

# Handle static assets
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/assets/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/static/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/.*\.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]

# Security headers
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
    Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
</IfModule>

# Cache static assets
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/svg+xml "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType font/woff "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType font/woff2 "access plus 1 year"
</IfModule>
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

After uploading, test your website:

1. **Visit your domain** (e.g., `https://suvidhapos.in`)
2. **Test navigation** - click on different links
3. **Test direct URLs** - try accessing `https://suvidhapos.in/about` directly
4. **Test active navigation** - verify that the current page's link is highlighted in orange
5. **Test scroll behavior** - ensure pages scroll to top when navigating

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: 404 Errors on Direct URL Access
**Solution**: Ensure the `.htaccess` file is properly uploaded and contains the React Router rewrite rules.

### Issue 2: Assets Not Loading
**Solution**: Check that all files from the `dist` folder were uploaded, including the `assets` subfolder.

### Issue 3: Active Navigation Not Working
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and refresh the page. The active styling should work immediately.

### Issue 4: Slow Loading
**Solution**: The build includes optimized files with gzip compression. If still slow, check your hosting plan's performance.
